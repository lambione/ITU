    "# Exercise 6: Logistic regression and classification\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be pleased to find that the framework for logistic regression is very similar to that of the linear regression. For this exercise we use the `GLM` method in the statsmodels library (https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/glm.html), in which we specify the model via the model matrix `X`. There is also an equivalent method, `glm`, that allows specification via the formula API just as for linear regression. The sklearn library has also a `LogisticRegression` method, but note that it by default regularizes the estimated coefficients using an L2-penalty. To run a classical logistic regression with parameters estimated by maximum likelihood, you will need to set `penalty = 'none'`."
